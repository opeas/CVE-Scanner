# CVE-Scanner
# Simple automation for verifying the latest CVEs in open sources based on the CVEdetails.com website

## Purpose
Searching via the CVEdetails.com website to check if new CVE vulnerabilities have appeared for a given product. An additional feature using the last_tags.txt file prevents vulnerabilities from being repeated in the results on the days they have already been found.

Using the script allows bypassing the need to visit each individual page to check whether new vulnerabilities have been released. Instead, it only shows us the pages where something has actually appeared. This is particularly productive when checking vulnerabilities for a large number of products.

## Mechanism
The script, using the BeautifulSoup library, retrieves the HTML of the vulnerability page, the link to which is provided when calling the function. It then locates the latest "Published Date" of the highest-ranked vulnerability on the page. If the "Published Date" matches yesterday's or today's date, the script returns a value of True and proceeds to the check_last_tags function, where it checks in the last_tags.txt file whether the latest vulnerabilities have already been found today. If they have not been found yet, it displays a message in the terminal: "New vulnerability found," otherwise, it returns the opposite message.
